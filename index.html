    <h1>Bucky Barnes</h1>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Barnes">The actual wiki</a>

    <p>James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes Jr. is a fictional character appearing in American comic 
        books published by Marvel Comics. Originally introduced as a sidekick to Captain 
        America, the character was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby and first appeared in 
        Captain America Comics #1 (cover-dated March 1941) (which was published by Marvel's 
        predecessor, Timely Comics). Barnes' original costume (or one based on it) and the 
        Bucky nickname has been used by other heroes in the Marvel Universe over the years. 
        The character is brought back from supposed death as the brainwashed assassin cyborg 
        called Winter Soldier. The character's memories and personality are later restored, 
        leading him to become a dark hero in search of redemption. He temporarily assumes the 
        role of "Captain America" when Steve Rogers was presumed to be dead. During the 2011 
        crossover Fear Itself, Barnes is injected with the Infinity Formula, which increases 
        his natural vitality and physical traits in a way that is similar to (but less 
        powerful than) the super-soldier serum used on Captain America.</p>

    <p>Sebastian Stan portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films 
        Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), 
        Ant-Man (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), 
        Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), streaming television series 
        The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), and the animated series What If...? (2021) 
        as alternate versions.</p>

    <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>

    <h3>Origin and World War II</h3>

    <p>James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes Jr. is born in Shelbyville, Indiana in 1925.
        Barnes grows up as an Army brat alongside his much younger sister Rebecca "Becca" 
        Barnes (originally Rebecca is said to be the older sibling). Their mother Winnifred 
        Barnes dies when both children are still young. Later, their father James "Jimmy" 
        Barnes Sr. (originally said to be named George Barnes) is killed during a training 
        exercise at U.S. Army Camp Lehigh in Virginia in 1938. Bucky and Becca are adopted 
        into the care of their father's colleague Major Samson. Becca is sent to boarding 
        school (one account says she goes to live with her Aunt Ida in Albany) while Bucky 
        remains at Camp Lehigh and becomes its unofficial mascot of the camp, wearing a 
        uniform and becoming familiar with military life. By his middle teens, the savvy 
        Bucky makes a side-career of smuggling goods into the camp for the soldiers. 
        Engaging in exercises with the soldiers in training, Bucky shows a natural ability 
        for marksmanship and physical combat.</p>

    <h3>Winter Soldier</h3>

    <p>Department X scientists give Bucky Barnes a bionic arm to replace the one he lost. 
        After undergoing hypnotic training, he is used as a secret assassin called the 
        "Winter Soldier." In-between his various covert wetwork missions, he is kept in 
        cryogenic stasis, placing him in suspended animation for months and sometimes years 
        at a time. As technology improves, the Winter Soldier's bionic arm is regularly 
        updated.</p>
